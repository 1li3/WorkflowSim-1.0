{"name":"WorkflowSim","tagline":"Workflow Simulator for Scheduling, Clustering and Provisioing studies","body":"### Welcome to WorkflowSim Pages.\r\nWorkflowSim is a workflow simulator to support large-scale scheduling, clustering and provisioning studies. It is developed by Weiwei Chen, a Phd student from University of Southern California under the Apache License version 2.0. WorkflowSim is not yet fully completed and we welcome your contribution to this project. \r\n\r\nThis page introduces the basic features of WorkflowSim and how to install and run it with Eclipse or NetBeans.\r\n\r\n### 1. Use WorkflowSim with GitHub\r\n\r\n( It is suggested to use WorkflowSim if you are going to contribute back to this project, otherwise it is not required. )\r\n\r\nWe provide a youtube video to show the process described below. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvpPzZpMDzg)\r\n\r\n1.1 Register a GitHub account and fork your own branch\r\n\r\nGo to the repository page (https://github.com/WorkflowSim/WorkflowSim-1.0) and click 'Fork' on the top-right corner next to 'Star'. Then you will have your own branch of WorkflowSim and you can maintain your codes under this branch and commit your changes to it. In the video, we use 'chenww05' as an example and you will see a new repo called chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0. Go to your repo, and copy the path. In this case, it is \"https://github.com/chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0.git\". \r\n\r\n1.2 Install EGit\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen your Eclipse, go to 'Help'->'Install New Software', in 'Work with', choose '--All Available Sites', make sure you have EGit listed, otherwise click the item and install it. \r\n### 2. Use WorkflowSim without GitHub\r\n( If you don't want to contribute back to WorkflowSim with your codes, you can use WorkflowSim without GitHub. )\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 Check out your source codes\r\n\r\nFirst, create a new java project called 'WorkflowSim' (it doesn't have to be 'WorkflowSim'). Right click your project, choose 'Import'. Click 'Git'->'Projects from Git'. Set the URL to be \"https://github.com/chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0.git\". And then you will see a branch called 'master', tick it and continue. And you don't need import projects again so just cancel. \r\n\r\nRight click the project again and choose 'Properties'. Go to 'Java Build Path'. Link two source directories (your_repo_root/examples, your_repo_root/sources)to the source folders. Add two external JARs (your_repo_root/lib/flanagan.jar and your_repo_root/lib/jdom-2.0.0.jar) to the Libraries.  \r\n\r\n1.4 Set Main class and configuration\r\n\r\nGo to 'Run'->'Run Configurations'->'Java Application'->'WorkflowSimExample1'. Make sure the Main class is 'org.workflowsim.examples.WorkflowSimExample1' although by default Eclipse should set the main class for you automatically. \r\n\r\nClick the 'Arguments', in the 'Program arguments', please add\r\n```\r\n-p your_repo_root/config/balanced/cybershake.txt\r\n```\r\nIn this case, we use cybershake workflow as an example. \r\nOpen your_repo_root/config/balanced/cybershake.txt, there is one line:\r\n```\r\ndax.path\t= /Users/chenweiwei/ResearchAndTech/Research/balanced_clustering/generator/BharathiPaper/Inspiral_1000.xml\r\n```\r\nReplace it with \r\n```\r\ndax.path = your_repo_root/config/balanced/dax/CyberShake_100.xml. \r\n```\r\nCyberShake_100.xml is a dax file for cybershake workflow with 100 tasks in it. You can try other dax files provided under the same directory. \r\nOther parameters would not cause an error but they have specified the simulation details. For details of these parameters, please refer to other pages. \r\n\r\n1.5 Run an Example\r\n\r\nAfter you have done all the changes, you can click 'Run' and the output contains the completion time of each job (if you use task clustering) or each task. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
